       " 'Down the Rabbit-Hole\\r \\r \\r Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\\r bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\\r the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\\r conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice\\r “without pictures or conversations?”\\r \\r So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\\r hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\\r making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\\r picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\\r close by her.',\n",
       " 'There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\\r so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh\\r dear!',\n",
       " 'Oh dear!',\n",
       " 'I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,\\r it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\\r time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\\r watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\\r on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\\r had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\\r watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\\r field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\\r large rabbit-hole under the hedge.',\n",
       " 'In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\\r in the world she was to get out again.',\n",
       " 'The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\\r dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\\r about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\\r deep well.',\n",
       " 'Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\\r plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\\r was going to happen next.',\n",
       " 'First, she tried to look down and make out\\r what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\\r looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\\r cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\\r hung upon pegs.',\n",
       " 'She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\\r passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great\\r disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\\r of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\\r cupboards as she fell past it.',\n",
       " '“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall\\r think nothing of tumbling down stairs!',\n",
       " 'How brave they’ll all think me\\r at home!',\n",
       " 'Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\\r top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)',\n",
       " 'Down, down, down.',\n",
       " 'Would the fall _never_ come to an end?',\n",
       " '“I wonder how\\r many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud.',\n",
       " '“I must be\\r getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.',\n",
       " 'Let me see: that would\\r be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt\\r several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\\r though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\\r knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\\r practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but\\r then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no\\r idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\\r grand words to say.)',\n",
       " 'Presently she began again.',\n",
       " '“I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\\r the earth!',\n",
       " 'How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\\r with their heads downward!',\n",
       " 'The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather\\r glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all\\r the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\\r country is, you know.',\n",
       " 'Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”\\r (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re\\r falling through the air!',\n",
       " 'Do you think you could manage it?)',\n",
       " '“And what\\r an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking!',\n",
       " 'No, it’ll never do\\r to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\\r \\r Down, down, down.',\n",
       " 'There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\\r talking again.',\n",
       " '“Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”\\r (Dinah was the cat.)',\n",
       " '“I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\\r tea-time.',\n",
       " 'Dinah my dear!',\n",
       " 'I wish you were down here with me!',\n",
       " 'There are\\r no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s\\r very like a mouse, you know.',\n",
       " 'But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here\\r Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\\r dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats?',\n",
       " 'Do cats eat bats?” and\\r sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer\\r either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it.',\n",
       " 'She felt\\r that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\\r walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\\r “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,\\r thump!',\n",
       " 'thump!',\n",
       " 'down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\\r the fall was over.',\n",
       " 'Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\\r she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\\r long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\\r it.',\n",
       " 'There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\\r and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears\\r and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she\\r turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\\r herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\\r from the roof.',\n",
       " 'There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\\r Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\\r door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\\r get out again.',\n",
       " 'Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\\r glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s\\r first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\\r but, alas!',\n",
       " 'either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\\r but at any rate it would not open any of them.',\n",
       " 'However, on the second\\r time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\\r behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\\r little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!',\n",
       " 'Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\\r much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\\r passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.',\n",
       " 'How she longed to get\\r out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\\r flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\\r through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought\\r poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders.',\n",
       " 'Oh,\\r how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!',\n",
       " 'I think I could, if I only\\r knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\\r happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\\r indeed were really impossible.',\n",
       " 'There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\\r back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\\r any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\\r time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here\\r before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\\r label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large\\r letters.',\n",
       " 'It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was\\r not going to do _that_ in a hurry.',\n",
       " '“No, I’ll look first,” she said,\\r “and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read\\r several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\\r eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\\r _would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\\r such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\\r and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\\r bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\\r bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,\\r sooner or later.',\n",
       " 'However, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to\\r taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\\r flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\\r hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.',\n",
       " '*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\r \\r     *      *      *      *      *      *\\r \\r *      *      *      *      *      *      *\\r \\r \\r “What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a\\r telescope.”\\r \\r And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\\r brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\\r through the little door into that lovely garden.',\n",
       " 'First, however, she\\r waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\\r she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”\\r said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle.',\n",
       " 'I\\r wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the\\r flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\\r not remember ever having seen such a thing.',\n",
       " 'After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\\r into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!',\n",
       " 'when she got to the\\r door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\\r went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\\r it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\\r best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\\r and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\\r sat down and cried.',\n",
       " '“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,\\r rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally\\r gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\\r and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\\r her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\\r cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\\r for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.',\n",
       " '“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two\\r people!',\n",
       " 'Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\\r person!”\\r \\r Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\\r she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\\r “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants.',\n",
       " '“Well, I’ll eat it,” said\\r Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\\r makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll\\r get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”\\r \\r She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way?',\n",
       " 'Which\\r way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\\r growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\\r size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\\r had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\\r things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\\r on in the common way.',\n",
       " 'So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.',\n",
       " '*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\r \\r     *      *      *      *      *      *\\r \\r *      *      *      *      *      *      *\\r \\r \\r \\r \\r CHAPTER II.',\n",
       " 'The Pool of Tears\\r \\r \\r “Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\\r for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m\\r opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!',\n",
       " 'Good-bye, feet!”\\r (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\\r sight, they were getting so far off).',\n",
       " '“Oh, my poor little feet, I\\r wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?',\n",
       " 'I’m\\r sure _I_ shan’t be able!',\n",
       " 'I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\\r myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be\\r kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I\\r want to go!',\n",
       " 'Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every\\r Christmas.”\\r \\r And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.',\n",
       " '“They must\\r go by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending\\r presents to one’s own feet!',\n",
       " 'And how odd the directions will look!',\n",
       " '_Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\\r      Alice’s love_).',\n",
       " 'Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”\\r \\r Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\\r now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\\r key and hurried off to the garden door.',\n",
       " 'Poor Alice!',\n",
       " 'It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\\r look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\\r hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.',\n",
       " '“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like\\r you,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way!',\n",
       " 'Stop\\r this moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding\\r gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\\r four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.',\n",
       " 'After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\\r she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.',\n",
       " 'It was the White\\r Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\\r in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\\r great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh!',\n",
       " 'the Duchess, the\\r Duchess!',\n",
       " 'Oh!',\n",
       " 'won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt\\r so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\\r Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,\\r sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\\r the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.',\n",
       " 'Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\\r kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear!',\n",
       " 'How\\r queer everything is to-day!',\n",
       " 'And yesterday things went on just as usual.',\n",
       " 'I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night?',\n",
       " 'Let me think: was I the\\r same when I got up this morning?',\n",
       " 'I almost think I can remember feeling\\r a little different.',\n",
       " 'But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who\\r in the world am I?',\n",
       " 'Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began\\r thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\\r herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.',\n",
       " '“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long\\r ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t\\r be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh!',\n",
       " 'she knows such a\\r very little!',\n",
       " 'Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how\\r puzzling it all is!',\n",

       " '“How cheerfully he seems to grin,\\r     How neatly spread his claws,\\r And welcome little fishes in\\r     With gently smiling jaws!”\\r \\r \\r “I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes\\r filled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and\\r I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\\r no toys to play with, and oh!',\n",

       " 'Tell me that first, and\\r then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down\\r here till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden\\r burst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down!',\n",
       " 'I am so\\r _very_ tired of being all alone here!”\\r \\r As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\\r that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while\\r she was talking.',\n",
       " '“How _can_ I have done that?” she thought.',\n",
       " '“I must be\\r growing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure\\r herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\\r now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\\r found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\\r dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.',\n",
       " '“That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\\r sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and\\r now for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little\\r door: but, alas!',\n",
       " 'the little door was shut again, and the little golden\\r key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than\\r ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this\\r before, never!',\n",
       " 'And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”\\r \\r As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\\r splash!',\n",
       " 'she was up to her chin in salt water.',\n",
       " 'Her first idea was that\\r she had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by\\r railway,” she said to herself.',\n",
       " '(Alice had been to the seaside once in\\r her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\\r to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\\r sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\\r of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.)',\n",
       " 'However, she\\r soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\\r she was nine feet high.',\n",
       " '“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying\\r to find her way out.',\n",
       " '“I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\\r being drowned in my own tears!',\n",
       " 'That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\\r sure!',\n",
       " 'However, everything is queer to-day.”\\r \\r Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\\r off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\\r it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\\r she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\\r slipped in like herself.',\n",
       " '“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?',\n",
       " 'Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\\r likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she\\r began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool?',\n",
       " 'I am very tired\\r of swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right\\r way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\\r she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of\\r a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather\\r inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\\r but it said nothing.',\n",
       " '“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s\\r a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all\\r her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\\r anything had happened.)',\n",
       " 'So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which\\r was the first sentence in her French lesson-book.',\n",
       " 'The Mouse gave a\\r sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\\r fright.',\n",
       " '“Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\\r had hurt the poor animal’s feelings.',\n",
       " '“I quite forgot you didn’t like\\r cats.”\\r \\r “Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice.',\n",
       " '“Would\\r _you_ like cats if you were me?”\\r \\r “Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry\\r about it.',\n",
       " 'And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d\\r take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.',\n",
       " 'She is such a dear\\r quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\\r in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\\r paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\\r nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your\\r pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\\r over, and she felt certain it must be really offended.',\n",
       " '“We won’t talk\\r about her any more if you’d rather not.”\\r \\r “We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\\r tail.',\n",
       " '“As if _I_ would talk on such a subject!',\n",
       " 'Our family always\\r _hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things!',\n",
       " 'Don’t let me hear the name\\r again!”\\r \\r “I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\\r conversation.',\n",
       " '“Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not\\r answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near\\r our house I should like to show you!',\n",
       " 'A little bright-eyed terrier, you\\r know, with oh, such long curly brown hair!',\n",
       " 'And it’ll fetch things when\\r you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\\r of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you\\r know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds!',\n",
       " 'He says\\r it kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\\r “I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away\\r from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\\r pool as it went.',\n",
       " 'So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear!',\n",
       " 'Do come back again, and we\\r won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the\\r Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\\r was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\\r trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my\\r history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”\\r \\r It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\\r birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\\r Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.',\n",
       " 'Alice\\r led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER III.',\n",

       " 'The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\\r consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\\r natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\\r she had known them all her life.',\n",
       " 'Indeed, she had quite a long argument\\r with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am\\r older than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow\\r without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\\r tell its age, there was no more to be said.',\n",
       " 'At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\\r called out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!',\n",
       " '_I’ll_ soon make\\r you dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\\r Mouse in the middle.',\n",

       " '“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,\\r as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will\\r tell you how the Dodo managed it.)',\n",

       " 'Prizes!”\\r \\r Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\\r pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\\r not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.',\n",

       " '“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\\r sighing.',\n",
       " '“It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder\\r at the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on\\r puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the\\r tale was something like this:—\\r \\r          “Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both\\r          go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no\\r          denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve\\r          nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear\\r          sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’\\r          ‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll\\r          try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”\\r \\r “You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely.',\n",
       " '“What are\\r you thinking of?”\\r \\r “I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth\\r bend, I think?”\\r \\r “I had _not!_” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.',\n",
       " '“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\\r anxiously about her.',\n",
       " '“Oh, do let me help to undo it!”\\r \\r “I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and\\r walking away.',\n",
       " '“You insult me by talking such nonsense!”\\r \\r “I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice.',\n",
       " '“But you’re so easily offended,\\r you know!”\\r \\r The Mouse only growled in reply.',\n",
       " '“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and\\r the others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only\\r shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.',\n",
       " '“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was\\r quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to\\r her daughter “Ah, my dear!',\n",
       " 'Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\\r _your_ temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little\\r snappishly.',\n",

       " '“I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for\\r days and days.”\\r \\r “But what am _I_ to do?” said Alice.',\n",
       " '“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.',\n",
       " '“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s\\r perfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.',\n",
       " 'The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\\r one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\\r in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,\\r stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.',\n",
       " '“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to\\r herself, as well as she could for sneezing.',\n",
       " 'There was certainly too much of it in the air.',\n",
       " 'Even the Duchess sneezed\\r occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\\r alternately without a moment’s pause.',\n",
       " 'The only things in the kitchen\\r that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\\r on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.',\n",
       " '“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\\r not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why\\r your cat grins like that?”\\r \\r “It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why.',\n",
       " 'Pig!”\\r \\r She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\\r jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\\r baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—\\r \\r “I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t\\r know that cats _could_ grin.”\\r \\r “They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”\\r \\r “I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite\\r pleased to have got into a conversation.',\n",
       " '“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”\\r \\r Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\\r be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.',\n",
       " 'While she\\r was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\\r fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\\r the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a\\r shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes.',\n",
       " 'The Duchess took no notice of\\r them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\\r that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.',\n",
       " '“Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down\\r in an agony of terror.',\n",
       " '“Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an\\r unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\\r off.',\n",
       " '“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse\\r growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”\\r \\r “Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to\\r get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge.',\n",
       " '“Just\\r think of what work it would make with the day and night!',\n",
       " 'You see the\\r earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”\\r \\r “Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”\\r \\r Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\\r the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\\r be listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or\\r is it twelve?',\n",
       " 'I—”\\r \\r “Oh, don’t bother _me_,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide\\r figures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\\r sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\\r the end of every line:\\r \\r “Speak roughly to your little boy,\\r     And beat him when he sneezes:\\r He only does it to annoy,\\r     Because he knows it teases.”\\r \\r \\r CHORUS.',\n",
       " '(In which the cook and the baby joined):\\r \\r \\r “Wow!',\n",
       " 'wow!',\n",
       " 'wow!”\\r \\r \\r While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\\r the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\\r that Alice could hardly hear the words:—\\r \\r “I speak severely to my boy,\\r     I beat him when he sneezes;\\r For he can thoroughly enjoy\\r     The pepper when he pleases!”\\r \\r \\r CHORUS.',\n",
       " '“Wow!',\n",

       " '“I must go and get ready to play\\r croquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room.',\n",
       " 'The cook\\r threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.',\n",
       " 'Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\\r little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\\r “just like a star-fish,” thought Alice.',\n",
       " 'The poor little thing was\\r snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\\r itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\\r the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.',\n",
       " 'As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\\r twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\\r ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it\\r out into the open air.',\n",
       " '“If I don’t take this child away with me,”\\r thought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be\\r murder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the\\r little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).',\n",
       " '“Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of\\r expressing yourself.”\\r \\r The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\\r to see what was the matter with it.',\n",
       " 'There could be no doubt that it had\\r a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\\r its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\\r not like the look of the thing at all.',\n",
       " '“But perhaps it was only\\r sobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\\r were any tears.',\n",
       " 'No, there were no tears.',\n",
       " '“If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,”\\r said Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you.',\n",
       " 'Mind\\r now!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\\r to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.',\n",
       " 'Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do\\r with this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so\\r violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm.',\n",
       " 'This time\\r there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\\r a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\\r further.',\n",
       " 'So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\\r trot away quietly into the wood.',\n",
       " '“If it had grown up,” she said to\\r herself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\\r rather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other\\r children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\\r to herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she\\r was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\\r a tree a few yards off.',\n",
       " 'The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.',\n",
       " 'It looked good-natured, she\\r thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she\\r felt that it ought to be treated with respect.',\n",
       " '“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\\r whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little\\r wider.',\n",
       " '“Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on.',\n",
       " '“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”\\r \\r “That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.',\n",
       " '“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.',\n",
       " '“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.',\n",
       " '“—so long as I get _somewhere_,” Alice added as an explanation.',\n",
       " '“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long\\r enough.”\\r \\r Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\\r question.',\n",
       " '“What sort of people live about here?”\\r \\r “In _that_ direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives\\r a Hatter: and in _that_ direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a\\r March Hare.',\n",

       " 'You grant that?”\\r \\r “I suppose so,” said Alice.',\n",
       " '“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry,\\r and wags its tail when it’s pleased.',\n",
       " 'Now _I_ growl when I’m pleased,\\r and wag my tail when I’m angry.',\n",

       " '“Do you play croquet with the\\r Queen to-day?”\\r \\r “I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited\\r yet.”\\r \\r “You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.',\n",
       " 'Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\\r things happening.',\n",
       " 'While she was looking at the place where it had been,\\r it suddenly appeared again.',\n",

       " 'Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\\r appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\\r which the March Hare was said to live.',\n",
       " '“I’ve seen hatters before,” she\\r said to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\\r perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it\\r was in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\\r again, sitting on a branch of a tree.',\n",
       " '“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.',\n",
       " '“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing\\r and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”\\r \\r “All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\\r beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\\r remained some time after the rest of it had gone.',\n",
       " '“Well!',\n",
       " 'I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a\\r grin without a cat!',\n",
       " 'It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”\\r \\r She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\\r the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\\r chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur.',\n",
       " 'It\\r was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\\r nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\\r to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather\\r timidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all!',\n",
       " 'I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”\\r \\r \\r \\r \\r CHAPTER VII.',\n",
       " 'A Mad Tea-Party\\r \\r \\r There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\\r March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\\r between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\\r cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.',\n",
       " '“Very\\r uncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep,\\r I suppose it doesn’t mind.”\\r \\r The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\\r one corner of it: “No room!',\n",
       " 'No room!” they cried out when they saw\\r Alice coming.',\n",
       " '“There’s _plenty_ of room!” said Alice indignantly, and\\r she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.',\n",
       " '“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.',\n",

       " 'He had been looking at\\r Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\\r speech.',\n",
       " '“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some\\r severity; “it’s very rude.”\\r \\r The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\\r was, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”\\r \\r “Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice.',\n",
       " '“I’m glad they’ve\\r begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.',\n",

       " 'The Hatter was the first to break the silence.',\n",
       " '“What day of the month\\r is it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\\r pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\\r and holding it to his ear.',\n",

       " '“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled:\\r “you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”\\r \\r The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\\r it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\\r nothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the _best_ butter,\\r you know.”\\r \\r Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.',\n",
       " '“What a\\r funny watch!” she remarked.',\n",
       " '“It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t\\r tell what o’clock it is!”\\r \\r “Why should it?” muttered the Hatter.',\n",
       " '“Does _your_ watch tell you what\\r year it is?”\\r \\r “Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it\\r stays the same year for such a long time together.”\\r \\r “Which is just the case with _mine_,” said the Hatter.',\n",
       " 'Alice felt dreadfully puzzled, The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no\\r sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.',\n",

       " 'They’re dreadfully\\r fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any\\r one left alive!”\\r \\r She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\\r could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\\r appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\\r watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\\r to herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\\r to.”\\r \\r “How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\\r enough for it to speak with.',\n",
       " 'Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.',\n",
       " '“It’s no use\\r speaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one\\r of them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\\r down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\\r she had someone to listen to her.',\n",
       " 'The Cat seemed to think that there\\r was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.',\n",
       " '“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a\\r complaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear\\r oneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at\\r least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how\\r confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the\\r arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\\r ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only\\r it ran away when it saw mine coming!”\\r \\r “How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.',\n",
       " '“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed\\r that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\\r “—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”\\r \\r The Queen smiled and passed on.',\n",
       " '“Who _are_ you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and\\r looking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.',\n",

       " 'She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\\r executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\\r of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\\r whether it was her turn or not.',\n",
       " 'So she went in search of her hedgehog.',\n",
       " 'The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\\r to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\\r other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\\r the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\\r helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.',\n",
       " 'By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\\r was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t\\r matter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side\\r of the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\\r escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\\r friend.',\n",
       " 'When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\\r a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\\r the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\\r while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.',\n",
       " 'The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\\r the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\\r all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\\r what they said.',\n",

       " 'The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\\r beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.',\n",

       " 'The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\\r time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so\\r the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,\\r while the rest of the party went back to the game.',\n",

       " 'The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\\r she was out of sight: then it chuckled.',\n",

       " '“It’s all her fancy, that: they never\\r executes nobody, you know.',\n",
       " 'Come on!”\\r \\r “Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly\\r after it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”\\r \\r They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\\r sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\\r nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break.',\n",
       " 'She\\r pitied him deeply.',\n",
       " '“What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the\\r Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all\\r his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know.',\n",
       " 'Come on!”\\r \\r So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\\r full of tears, but said nothing.',\n",
       " '“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your\\r history, she do.”\\r \\r “I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit\\r down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”\\r \\r So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.',\n",
       " 'Alice thought to\\r herself, “I don’t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn’t begin.”\\r But she waited patiently.',\n",
       " '“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real\\r Turtle.”\\r \\r These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\\r occasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant\\r heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.',\n",
       " 'Alice was very nearly getting up and\\r saying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not\\r help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said\\r nothing.',\n",
       " '“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\\r though still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the\\r sea.',\n",
       " 'The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”\\r \\r “Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.',\n",
       " '“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle\\r angrily: “really you are very dull!”\\r \\r “You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\\r question,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked\\r at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.',\n",
       " 'At last the\\r Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow!',\n",
       " 'Don’t be all\\r day about it!” and he went on in these words:\\r \\r “Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”\\r \\r “I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.',\n",
       " '“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.',\n",
       " '“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.',\n",
       " 'The Mock Turtle went on.',\n",
       " '“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”\\r \\r “_I’ve_ been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so\\r proud as all that.”\\r \\r “With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.',\n",
       " '“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”\\r \\r “And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.',\n",
       " '“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.',\n",
       " '“Ah!',\n",
       " 'then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a\\r tone of great relief.',\n",
       " '“Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,\\r ‘French, music, _and washing_—extra.’”\\r \\r “You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom\\r of the sea.”\\r \\r “I couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh.',\n",
       " '“I\\r only took the regular course.”\\r \\r “What was that?” inquired Alice.',\n",
       " '“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle\\r replied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,\\r Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.”\\r \\r “I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say.',\n",
       " '“What is it?”\\r \\r The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.',\n",
       " '“What!',\n",
       " 'Never heard of\\r uglifying!” it exclaimed.',\n",
       " '“You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”\\r \\r “Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”\\r \\r “Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify\\r is, you _are_ a simpleton.”\\r \\r Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so\\r she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”\\r \\r “Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the\\r subjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with\\r Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\\r that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\\r Fainting in Coils.”\\r \\r “What was _that_ like?” said Alice.',\n",
       " '“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too\\r stiff.',\n",
       " 'And the Gryphon never learnt it.”\\r \\r “Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master,\\r though.',\n",
       " 'He was an old crab, _he_ was.”\\r \\r “I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught\\r Laughing and Grief, they used to say.”\\r \\r “So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\\r creatures hid their faces in their paws.',\n",
       " '“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry\\r to change the subject.',\n",
       " '“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so\\r on.”\\r \\r “What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.',\n",
       " '“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked:\\r “because they lessen from day to day.”\\r \\r This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\\r before she made her next remark.',\n",
       " '“Then the eleventh day must have been\\r a holiday?”\\r \\r “Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.',\n",
       " '“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.',\n",
       " '“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very\\r decided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”\\r \\r \\r \\r \\r CHAPTER X.',\n",
       " 'The Lobster Quadrille\\r \\r \\r The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\\r his eyes.',\n",
       " 'He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\\r two sobs choked his voice.',\n",
       " '“Same as if he had a bone in his throat,”\\r said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\\r the back.',\n",
       " 'At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\\r running down his cheeks, he went on again:—\\r \\r “You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said\\r Alice)—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—”\\r (Alice began to say “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and\\r said “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\\r Lobster Quadrille is!”\\r \\r “No, indeed,” said Alice.',\n",
       " '“What sort of a dance is it?”\\r \\r “Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the\\r sea-shore—”\\r \\r “Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle.',\n",
       " '“Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\\r then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”\\r \\r “_That_ generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.',\n",
       " '“—you advance twice—”\\r \\r “Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.',\n",
       " '“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”\\r \\r “—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.',\n",
       " '“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”\\r \\r “The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.',\n",
       " '“—as far out to sea as you can—”\\r \\r “Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.',\n",
       " '“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\\r about.',\n",
       " '“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.',\n",
       " '“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock\\r Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had\\r been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very\\r sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.',\n",
       " '“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.',\n",
       " '“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.',\n",
       " '“Very much indeed,” said Alice.',\n",
       " '“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the\\r Gryphon.',\n",

       " '“I’ve forgotten the words.”\\r \\r So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\\r then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\\r forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\\r and sadly:—\\r \\r “Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.',\n",
       " '“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.',\n",
       " 'See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!',\n",

       " '“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\\r When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”\\r But the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—\\r Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.',\n",
       " 'Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.',\n",
       " 'Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.',\n",

       " '“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve\\r seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”\\r \\r “I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully.',\n",
       " '“They have their tails in\\r their mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”\\r \\r “You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would\\r all wash off in the sea.',\n",

       " '“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they _would_ go with the\\r lobsters to the dance.',\n",
       " 'So they got thrown out to sea.',\n",
       " 'So they had to\\r fall a long way.',\n",
       " 'So they got their tails fast in their mouths.',\n",
       " 'So they\\r couldn’t get them out again.',\n",
       " 'That’s all.”\\r \\r “Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting.',\n",
       " 'I never knew so much\\r about a whiting before.”\\r \\r “I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon.',\n",
       " '“Do you\\r know why it’s called a whiting?”\\r \\r “I never thought about it,” said Alice.',\n",
       " '“Why?”\\r \\r “_It does the boots and shoes_,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.',\n",
       " 'Alice was thoroughly puzzled.',\n",

       " '“Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?” said the Gryphon.',\n",
       " '“I mean, what\\r makes them so shiny?”\\r \\r Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\\r answer.',\n",
       " '“They’re done with blacking, I believe.”\\r \\r “Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\\r “are done with a whiting.',\n",
       " 'Now you know.”\\r \\r “And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.',\n",
       " '“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\\r “any shrimp could have told you that.”\\r \\r “If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still\\r running on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back,\\r please: we don’t want _you_ with us!’”\\r \\r “They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no\\r wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”\\r \\r “Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.',\n",
       " '“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to _me_,\\r and told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’”\\r \\r “Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.',\n",
       " '“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone.',\n",
       " 'And\\r the Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of _your_ adventures.”\\r \\r “I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said\\r Alice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday,\\r because I was a different person then.”\\r \\r “Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.',\n",
       " '“No, no!',\n",
       " 'The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\\r “explanations take such a dreadful time.”\\r \\r So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\\r saw the White Rabbit.',\n",
       " 'She was a little nervous about it just at first,\\r the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\\r their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she\\r went on.',\n",
       " 'Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\\r about her repeating “_You are old, Father William_,” to the\\r Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\\r Turtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”\\r \\r “It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.',\n",

       " 'Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\\r her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\\r grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\\r the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\\r as long as there was room for her.',\n",

       " '“Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\\r began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident\\r of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of\\r idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the\\r jury-box, or they would die.',\n",
       " '“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice, “until\\r all the jurymen are back in their proper places—_all_,” he repeated\\r with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.',\n",

       " '“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a\\r letter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.”\\r \\r “It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to\\r nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.”\\r \\r “Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.',\n",
       " '“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’s\\r nothing written on the _outside_.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke,\\r and added “It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.”\\r \\r “Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.',\n",
       " '“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest\\r thing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)',\n",

       " 'You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed\\r your name like an honest man.”\\r \\r There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\\r clever thing the King had said that day.',\n",

       " '_I_ don’t believe there’s\\r an atom of meaning in it.”\\r \\r The jury all wrote down on their slates, “_She_ doesn’t believe there’s\\r an atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the\\r paper.',\n",

       " '(The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\\r slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\\r began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\\r as it lasted.)',\n",

       " '“You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”\\r \\r At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\\r her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\\r tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\\r head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\\r leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.',\n",
       " '“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve\\r had!”\\r \\r “Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her\\r sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\\r Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she\\r had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It _was_ a curious\\r dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”\\r So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\\r what a wonderful dream it had been.',\n",
       " 'But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\\r hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\\r her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\\r and this was her dream:—\\r \\r First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\\r hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\\r looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and\\r see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\\r that _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or\\r seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\\r strange creatures of her little sister’s dream.',\n",
       " 'The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the\\r frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she\\r could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\\r shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\\r ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby\\r was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\\r around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\\r Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\\r filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\\r Turtle.',\n",
       " 'So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\\r Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\\r would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the\\r wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling\\r teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill\\r cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the\\r shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\\r (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the\\r lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\\r Turtle’s heavy sobs.',\n",
       " 'Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\\r would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\\r keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\\r childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,\\r and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\\r perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she\\r would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\\r their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer\\r days.',\n",
